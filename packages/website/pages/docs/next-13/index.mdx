# Next.js 13

With the introduction of the `app` directory, Next.js 13 provides a new level of flexibility for React apps.

Next.js is removing their built-in [internationalized routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/i18n-routing), leaving the implementation of this up to the user. To fill in the gap, `next-intl` provides a **drop-in replacement for the i18n routing**, handling the locale negotiation, redirects and cookies.

The other major change for `next-intl` is the support for **React Server Components**.

There are currently two ways how you can set your app up with `next-intl` in the `app` directory:

1. [Deferring the usage of `next-intl` to Client Components](/docs/next-13/client-components) (stable, recommended when you migrate)
2. [Using `next-intl` in Server Components](/docs/next-13/server-components) (preview)
